# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview

Dana is a data journalist who has been interested in UFOs since she was a young child.  When she is given the opportunity to write about her hometown of McMinnville, Oregon, she jumps at the chance.  After all, McMinnville is known for its UFO sightings, which is what kickstarted her interest in the topic in the first place.

To go along with her story, Dana wants to create a webpage to allow people to read up on various UFO sightings.  She is currently equipped with a javascript file containing information on over one hundred different sightings.  While this features a lot of information, it isn't exactly user-friendly.  She wants to display this data on a webpage so that it is not only easy to read, but easy to sort through as well.

We initially loaded the data into a table so that it would be easy to read and gave the user the ability to sort via date.  While this was a good start, Dana wanted to provide even more flexibility by adding the ability to also sort by city, state, country, and shape of the sighted UFO.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
